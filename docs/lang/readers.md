Stutter programs begin their life as data structures stored somewhere. They can
be stored in several formats including JSON, XML, YAML, etc as well as stutter's
own stutter data notation (SDN). They  can be retrieved from any source capable
of storing the general data structures (files, databases, etc). It is a Readers
responsibility to convert the given format into the basic data structures.
