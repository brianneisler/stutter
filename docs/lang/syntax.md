# Syntax

Stutter's Syntax is simple. It is composed of a few simple fundamental concepts that together create a significant amount of flexibility.

## Concepts
- Stutter uses whitespace as separators




### Meta info on Maps and Lists

Meta info on maps is stored on the `$` property.

- Literal representations of data (numbers, strings, lists, maps, etc)

Rules
- Stutter evaluates every form to produce a value.



## Symbols

Symbols begin with a non-numeric character and can contain alphanumeric characters. No special characters are allowed in symbols. All special characters are reserved as operators.
